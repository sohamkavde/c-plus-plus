13 love bubber video lecture
	1 binary to decimal *assuming binary as a number #R
	2 second method to get decimal number from binary input using pow function , here I am focusing on 1 ans neglating 0
	3 complement of given bits
	4 return true if n is divided by 2^x
	5 Get nCr , important thing is long long datatype because when we multiply any postive number that's value increase very fast  #R
	6 alernate arrange element like 1 2 3 4 5 to 2 1 4 3 5 or 1 2 3 4 5 6 to  2 1 4 3 6 5 #R
	7 given array like 1,2,3,1,2,3,4 ans 4 ,Four has no duplicatation #R
	8 find intersection or same element from two given array
	9 Print pair value which will going to form sum of given number k, like 1 2 3 is array and 3 is value of k so 1+2=3. (1,2) is pair  and answer #R
	11 10 find triplet
	12 two pointer approach 0 1 0 1 to 0 0 1 1 
	13 find duplicate value from given number when every given element is positive integer
	14 find duplicate value from given number when every given element is positive integer
	#binary
	15 find the pick element from the mountain array
	16 find pivot(smallest number in array in log(n)) in rotated sorted array
	find number  but this program throw time limit exceed
	m= student , arr elements are pages , n=size of array
	find the maximum in minimum element aisa hi kuch hint ke lie dia rahenga (arr[4] = {5,5,5,5}; painter(k) = 2; here 5,5,5,5 is board to paint)
